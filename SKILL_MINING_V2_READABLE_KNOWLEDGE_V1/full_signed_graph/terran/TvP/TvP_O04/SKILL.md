## Skill Identity

- Skill ID: TvP_O04
- Matchup: Terran vs Protoss
- Opening Family: expansion / economy / technology opening
- Method: Full Signed Graph

## Opening Strategy

This opening emphasizes a heavy economy and technology posture with a ground-leaning army composition. It is designed to secure a strong economic foundation while teching up, maintaining moderate production to defend and apply pressure. The approach is flexible, allowing adaptation based on scouting and opponent actions.

Develop a expansion / economy / technology posture while preserving flexibility for live observation-driven adaptation.

This is a strategic template, not a fixed build order.

## Strategic Characteristics

- Economy: heavy
- Production: moderate
- Technology: heavy
- Army direction: ground-leaning

## Strategic Priorities

- Preserve the opening's strategic identity without reproducing a fixed sequence.
- Check current Completed, Under Construction, Active Queues, resources, supply, and prerequisites before choosing exact macro actions.
- Match any adaptation against partial Enemy Intelligence and current Threat Flags.
- Re-evaluate economy, production, technology, and army trade-offs at every decision.
