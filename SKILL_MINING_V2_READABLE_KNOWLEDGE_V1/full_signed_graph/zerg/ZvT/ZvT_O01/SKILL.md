- Matchup: Zerg vs Terran
- Opening Family: economy / expansion / ground opening
- Method: Full Signed Graph

## Opening Strategy

This opening prioritizes a robust economy and early expansion, with a ground-leaning army composition and moderate production. It is designed as a flexible strategic template, not a fixed build order, allowing adaptation based on live observation of the opponent's actions.

Develop a economy / expansion / ground posture while preserving flexibility for live observation-driven adaptation.

This is a strategic template, not a fixed build order.

## Strategic Characteristics

- Economy: heavy
- Production: moderate
- Technology: light_or_uncertain
- Army direction: ground-leaning

## Strategic Priorities

- Preserve the opening's strategic identity without reproducing a fixed sequence.
- Check current Completed, Under Construction, Active Queues, resources, supply, and prerequisites before choosing exact macro actions.
- Match any adaptation against partial Enemy Intelligence and current Threat Flags.
- Re-evaluate economy, production, technology, and army trade-offs at every decision.
