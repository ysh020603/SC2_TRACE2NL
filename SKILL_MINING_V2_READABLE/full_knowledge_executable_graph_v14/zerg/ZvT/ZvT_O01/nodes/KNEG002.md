# KNEG002 — Resource-to-Army Conversion Failure

## Node Type

NEGATIVE

## Summary

The agent is in a negative node where the primary failure signal is resource-to-army conversion failure, indicating that despite a heavy economy, the army is not being produced effectively. Avoid continuing to expand or invest in technology without also increasing army production. Do not neglect army composition or fail to respond to the opponent's ground forces.

## When This Applies

### Opponent cues

- Enemy Intelligence is consistent with a ground posture; representative observed or remembered cues may include Marine, Reaper. Production appears heavy, technology investment appears heavy, and exact hidden counts remain unknown.
- Treat remembered or observed Enemy Intelligence as partial and uncertain.

### Own cues

- Your economy is heavy and your expansion posture is heavy, but your production is only moderate. You have a ground-oriented army with Zerglings, Queens, Roaches, and Hydralisks, and you are investing in technology such as zerglingmovementspeed and Burrow. However, the failure signal suggests that resources are not being converted into army strength efficiently.
- Use the live observation to check army supply, free supply, resource bank, technology, and current queues.
- These cues are approximate and do not all need to be true.

## Human-Trajectory Interpretation

The trajectory shows a focus on economy and expansion with Zerglings, Queens, and Roaches, but the negative node indicates that this economy is not being converted into army strength effectively. The presence of Hydralisks and zerglingmovementspeed suggests a tech investment, but the production is only moderate, leading to a failure to field a sufficient army.

## Applicability Checks

- Check if the economy is heavy and production is moderate, indicating a potential resource-to-army conversion issue.
- Check if the army composition is ground-oriented and if the opponent is also ground-oriented, making ground units relevant.
- Check if the technology investment is heavy, which may be diverting resources from army production.

## General Failure Mode

Resource-to-army conversion failure: the economy is heavy but the army is not being produced effectively, leading to a weak military presence despite strong economy.

## Risk Direction

Historical matched contexts associate this broad direction with worse outcomes; the evidence is associative, not causal.

Avoid continuing to expand or invest in technology without also increasing army production. Do not neglect army composition or fail to respond to the opponent's ground forces.

## Safer Re-evaluation

Recheck the resource-to-army conversion by comparing the number of active production structures and the rate of army unit production against the resource income. If the conversion is still failing, consider building additional production structures or adjusting the unit composition to better counter the opponent's ground forces.

## What This Does NOT Mean

This node is not an instruction to reproduce a historical action sequence.

Choose exact macro actions from the current live observation, not merely because a unit or structure appeared in historical evidence.

## Transition Goal

Transition from a negative state to a positive one by improving resource-to-army conversion, increasing production, and maintaining a strong ground army.

## Knowledge-Grounded Execution Envelope

**Human-trajectory candidate pool (not an ordered build list):** Zergling, Queen, Overlord, Roach, Hydralisk, Overseer

- Selection: Choose only a currently reachable candidate after checking live producers, prerequisites, resources, supply, and active queues; this is a candidate pool, not an ordered build list.
- Resource conversion: When the combined bank is at least 750 and army supply is still below 15 after 05:00, prefer a currently executable combat candidate from this pool before optional greed or deeper technology.
- Unreachable-candidate fallback: If the preferred candidate is not reachable before the next decision, use a cheaper currently producible trajectory candidate; do not queue a long blocked prerequisite chain while army supply is low.
- Feedback repair: If the bank/low-army deficit persists for two decisions, stop repeating the same plan, re-read the best matching node, and choose a different reachable candidate or producer bottleneck repair.

## Routing Boundary

This is a negative experience branch. Use it only to identify the matched failure mode, safer re-evaluation, stop condition, and reachable repair. Never reproduce the failed direction.
