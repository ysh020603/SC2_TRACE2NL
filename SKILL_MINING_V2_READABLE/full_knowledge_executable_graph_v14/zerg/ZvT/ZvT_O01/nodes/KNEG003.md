# KNEG003 — Ground Macro Posture with Heavy Economy and Production

## Node Type

NEGATIVE

## Summary

Late midgame phase with both sides showing heavy economy, expansion, production, and technology investment. Enemy intelligence is consistent with a ground posture, with representative cues including SiegeTank, Marine, Reaper, and Hellion. Own posture is ground-oriented with heavy production and technology, and representative cues include Zergling and Queen. Trajectory actions include Zergling, Overlord, Drone, Queen, Roach, CreepTumor, Extractor, Hydralisk, zerglingmovementspeed, and Overseer. Avoid resource-to-army conversion failure, where resources accumulate without being converted into army strength. Avoid feedback not changing repeated failed…

## When This Applies

### Opponent cues

- Enemy Intelligence is consistent with a ground posture; representative observed or remembered cues may include SiegeTank, Marine, Reaper, Hellion. Production appears heavy, technology investment appears heavy, and exact hidden counts remain unknown.
- Treat remembered or observed Enemy Intelligence as partial and uncertain.

### Own cues

- Your completed or developing posture is broadly ground-oriented, with heavy production and heavy technology investment. Check live Completed, Under Construction, Active Queues, resources, supply, and army strength before choosing exact actions.
- Use the live observation to check army supply, free supply, resource bank, technology, and current queues.
- These cues are approximate and do not all need to be true.

## Human-Trajectory Interpretation

The trajectory actions show a Zerg ground-oriented build with Zergling, Roach, Hydralisk, and Queen, supported by Overlord, CreepTumor, Extractor, and upgrades like zerglingmovementspeed. This aligns with a ground macro posture. The negative node type suggests that this trajectory may have encountered a failure, possibly due to inefficient resource conversion or lack of adaptation.

## Applicability Checks

- Check if the opponent has a significant air presence; if so, this ground-focused approach may need adjustment.
- Check if the opponent's composition includes heavy SiegeTank usage; if so, ensure you have appropriate counters or positioning.
- Check if your economy is over-invested relative to army strength; if so, prioritize army production.
- Check if you are supply blocked with a bank of resources; if so, address supply and production.
- Check if you have sufficient anti-air capabilities if the opponent transitions to air.

## General Failure Mode

Resource-to-army conversion failure or feedback not changing repeated failed posture.

## Risk Direction

Historical matched contexts associate this broad direction with worse outcomes; the evidence is associative, not causal.

Avoid resource-to-army conversion failure, where resources accumulate without being converted into army strength. Avoid feedback not changing repeated failed posture, where the same unsuccessful approach is repeated despite negative outcomes.

## Safer Re-evaluation

If resources are banking up without army production, prioritize spending on army and upgrades. If the same failed posture is repeated, change the approach based on observed opponent composition and map control. Recheck if the opponent transitions to air or shows a different composition.

## What This Does NOT Mean

This node is not an instruction to reproduce a historical action sequence.

Choose exact macro actions from the current live observation, not merely because a unit or structure appeared in historical evidence.

## Transition Goal

Transition to a stronger ground army composition that can handle the opponent's ground posture, while maintaining economy and production. Ensure that resources are efficiently converted into army and that feedback is used to adapt.

## Knowledge-Grounded Execution Envelope

**Human-trajectory candidate pool (not an ordered build list):** Zergling, Queen, Overlord, Roach, Hydralisk, Overseer

- Selection: Choose only a currently reachable candidate after checking live producers, prerequisites, resources, supply, and active queues; this is a candidate pool, not an ordered build list.
- Resource conversion: When the combined bank is at least 750 and army supply is still below 15 after 05:00, prefer a currently executable combat candidate from this pool before optional greed or deeper technology.
- Unreachable-candidate fallback: If the preferred candidate is not reachable before the next decision, use a cheaper currently producible trajectory candidate; do not queue a long blocked prerequisite chain while army supply is low.
- Feedback repair: If the bank/low-army deficit persists for two decisions, stop repeating the same plan, re-read the best matching node, and choose a different reachable candidate or producer bottleneck repair.

## Routing Boundary

This is a negative experience branch. Use it only to identify the matched failure mode, safer re-evaluation, stop condition, and reachable repair. Never reproduce the failed direction.
